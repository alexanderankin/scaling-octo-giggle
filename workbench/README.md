This data comes from [parcels n'at](//tools.wprdc.org/parcels-n-at/) and this
document contains my notes on how im processing it and the other contents of
this folder where I am learning about the data set.

## Parcels N'at

Data was downloaded by selecting these options:

|Step|Options|
|-|-:|
|1) Area|Allegheny County Municipality|
|1.5) Click on Map|Click on somewhere in the Pittsburgh Municipality|
|2) Select Fields|Land Use + Everything from PLI Violations|
|3) Download|CSV|

Data took 5-10 minutes to create and took up 120 MB of disk space.

Data appeared to be weirdly joined and attempt two was without violations.
